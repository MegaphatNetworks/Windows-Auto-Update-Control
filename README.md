# Windows-Auto-Update-Control
Stop Windows 7, 8, 10 from performing unwarranted auto-updates without user permissions.

I am so sick and tired of MS forcing these crappy updates on to my computers which cause me to lose work or even worse, cause BSOD's because the updates are flawed.  So I dug just deep enough into the registry to prevent the updates.
